## Project Overview

In this project, I've focused on creating a model that goes beyond traditional metrics to predict NHL prospects likely to outperform their draft positions. This is particularly beneficial for evaluating later round draft picks.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Engineering:** Crafting a model to assess difficult-to-measure qualities in NHL prospects.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Predicting prospects likely to outperform their draft positions.
- **Applications:** Valuable insights for evaluating later round draft picks.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Leveraged for data processing and modeling.
