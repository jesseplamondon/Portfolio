## Project Overview

In this project, I investigated early COVID-19 patient data to understand mortality rates across different age groups and evaluate the virus's effects on diverse populations. The findings have been presented through a recorded session to a broad audience, including both technical experts and those less familiar with data science.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Exploration:** In-depth analysis of early COVID-19 patient data.
- **Mortality Rates:** Understanding the narrative behind mortality rates across diverse age groups.
- **Population Impact:** Assessing the nuanced effects of the virus on different demographic groups.
