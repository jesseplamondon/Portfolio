In this repository, I have compiled four distinct projects highlighting my expertise in data science and software development.

## 1. [Data Analysis](/Data_Analysis)
Dive into my data gathering and analysis capabilities through a project that identifies regions of increasing shot quality based on 2022 NHL shot statistics. Discover how I used this model to evaluate the effectiveness of NHL goalies and goalie tandems across different shot quality groups. The applications extend to determining the cap efficiency of teams concerning their goaltending strategies.

## 2. [Data Engineering](/Data_Engineering)
Explore my data engineering skills with a project dedicated to characterizing NHL prospects. I've developed a model that goes beyond traditional metrics, focusing on qualities like drive, determination, and competitiveness. This model predicts prospects who are likely to outperform their draft position, especially beneficial for later round draft picks.

## 3. [End-to-End Data Science](/End-to-End)
Experience my end-to-end data science skills in a project that leverages early Covid-19 patient data. I've explored mortality rates across various age groups and assessed the virus's impact on different populations. I've even presented my findings to a diverse audience, including both technical and non-technical individuals. Check out the linked presentation in the project's README for a detailed overview.

## 4. [Web Development](/Web_Development)
View my web development prowess with a React.js project where my team of four students created an online flower store. This project showcases the seamless integration of modern frameworks, hosted locally with Docker.

Feel free to explore each project individually for a comprehensive look at my skills and achievements in the realms of data science and software development.
